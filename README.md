# Walrus
 
* What is a Reverse Shell?
  - A reverse shell, also known as a remote shell or ‚Äúconnect-back shell,‚Äù takes advantage of the target system‚Äôs vulnerabilities to initiate a shell session and then access the victim‚Äôs computer. The goal is to connect to a remote computer and redirect the input and output connections of the target system‚Äôs shell so the attacker can access it remotely.
* Why use Walrus?
  - Walrus includes many other features that other reverse shells do not offer, including a fully working file uploading and downloading system.
* Can I contribute?
  - Walrus Plus is an open-source project. We are committed to a fully transparent development process and highly appreciate any contributions. Whether you are helping us fix bugs, proposing new features, improving our documentation or spreading the word - we would love to have you as a part of the Walrus community.
